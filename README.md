## Overview

We created a fungible token called to kaseiCoin that is ERC-20 compliant for a Crowdsale contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library. You will learn to deploy three contracts to manage the entire crowdsale process.

---

## Requirements

This project leverages python version 3.7.11 with the following packages and modules:

- Solidity - Create the smart contract and implement the joints saving application to work with ether.

- Remix IDE - Write and edit solidity code to create the contracts

- MetaMask - Use digital wallet and a gateway for the Ethereum blockchain.

- Ganache - This is a tool that allows us to quickly set up a local blockchain, which we can use to test and develop smart contracts.

- OpenZeppelin - OpenZeppelin library provides a wide variety of contracts that are related to the ERC-20 token standard.
